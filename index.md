## **FOREWORDS**


*From* **: Jill#0627** 
This file is dedicated to running you through all commands of the bot and their functions. I figured it would be best if I could just add this function into the bot, which I 100% will do in the near future, but just to add some fun trivias and more information that you might need, I’m writing this file instead. And more information will be added. In short, this is a fully elaborate file while the functions I am going to add into the bot are going to be a simplified version.

### **WHAT IS JILL BOT?**

In short, Jill BOT is a passion project that I made in order to satisfy my passion with the game **“VA-11 HALL-A”**, which I deeply love. In a more elaborate answer, Jill BOT is multipurpose. She has moderation commands, she has fun commands, and other utilities, but most importantly, _**she is a bartender**_. I certainly tried and am trying my hardest so that the commands for drinks perform the best, and the most elegantly. I kind of had to roleplay as her in writing the scripts, but it was a good time. I never realized I relate to Jill this much, so I attribute it to this project. 
It takes me days working to get the bot up and running even after all the coding, so I am more than glad that she’s been providing services for multiple servers. 
At the start of all things, there were seemingly countless errors and I just could not fix them all. It was a very stressful experience for me because I also submitted her to **top.gg**. In the end, she passed the functionality tests and was allowed.


## **USER MANUALS**

_Every command starts with “jill!”, a.k.a the prefix, except for auto responses. So please understand that when I write a command in here, you need to manually add the prefix. Commands are not case-sensitive so you can type it in whichever way, just don’t add unnecessary spaces and it is going to work._

### **MENU**
*This is the reason why I made Jill BOT in the first place*
- Menu: Open the menu of drinks! It’s a miracle there.

- Recipe: Find recipes of the drink on the menu. Type the command and then type the drink’s name. Don’t forget the spaces!

- Seasonal: Open the menu of seasonal drinks (these are only available through certain periods)

### **MODERATION COMMANDS**

- Ban: ban a member. Please mention the member you want to ban. 

- Kick: kick a member. Please mention the member you want to kick.

- Mute/unmute: mute/unmute a member. Please mention the member you want to mute/unmute. Please also note that in order to use the function, you need to have the role “crime” (yes, it is very heavy). If you don’t have it and you want to make sure nothing goes wrong, manually type “jill!createmute” to create the role for you. Do note that the role’s permissions are customizable so you can actively decide what muted users can and cannot do.

- Createmute: create a role named “crime”. This role is specifically used to mute others, so please do not use it for any other purposes.

- Createrole: create a role. Type the name of the role you want to create after the command. Please note that due to skills reasons, I cannot make her create a custom color or custom position off the bat. The colors are random and permissions are customizable.

- Deleterole: deleting a role. Type the name of the role you want to create after the command. Please note that it cannot delete roles with emojis in the name. If you want to delete roles that do, please manually delete them.

### **UTILITIES COMMANDS**

- Help: Show the list of commands.

- Info: Show information of a user. Mention a user to see their information like date created, date joined, username and tag, user ID and their profile picture. If you do not mention anyone, the command will show your information.
Membercount: Count members of the server. It separates between bots and non-bot users too.
Serverinfo: Show member count, emoji count and role count.
Invite: Send an invite link to invite Jill BOT into your server.

- Serveravatar: Shows the server’s profile picture.

- Servercount: Show how many servers Jill BOT is in.

- Wikipedia: Search something on the wiki.

- Dictionary: Search something in the dictionary.

- Urban: Search something in the urban dictionary

### **FUN COMMANDS**

- Say: Make the bot say something for you (FUNCTION DEPRECATED DUE TO POTENTIAL ABUSE)

- Kill: kill someone that you mention (of course it won't be a real ordeal, haha)

- Choose: choosing between options

- Ghostping: ghostping someone (FUNCTION DEPRECATED DUE TO POTENTIAL AND REPORTED ABUSE)

- Jukebox: Provides you with a jukebox of only tracks from the game VA-11 HALL-A. For copyright issues, I will not be making a function that plays the tracks.

- Autorespond: Open the list of auto responses (You do not have to add prefixes for this specific type of command)

- Pat: Pat someone that you mention

- Hug: Hug someone that you mention.

- Kiss: Kiss someone that you mention.(Warning: VERY PASSIONATE KISS!)

- Stare at someone that you mention.

- Drink: Guide you on how to order a drink from the menu.

### **DEPRECATIONS**

> As a developer, I often find myself having too much fun with the codes, so some functions might go overboard on what they can do to a person or to others and become not nearly as fun as intended. This includes the “say” and “ghostping” commands, which reportedly have been used very abusively towards others. It is only a bot, but I want to make sure no harm could be done by using this bot. Hence I will deprecate any functions that are reported to be harmful, of course not without evidence. The functions will stay up for at most until 2 weeks later in the command list but they will not be usable.


## **DEVELOPER'S WORDS**
> When she got her first invite from people other than me, I was over the moon. And I thought, “let’s improve the bot even more so that I can satisfy all users.” I know nothing is perfect so it was a perfect chance to keep adding things, and the only limit is my creativity. Now it does a lot of things that I did not originally intend it to do, and they’re not really fitting with a “bartender bot”, but others seem to enjoy it. And I’m glad they do. 
I, as the developer, want to make your experience as good as it can get. So the bot will keep evolving. One day we will have a database that stores all the drinks. One day, maybe we can get a premium website up. One day, maybe Jill BOT will be verified, and one day, she will be a bot with little to no flaws, and a huge user base. But that one day will never come if I stop innovating, stop improving and be easily content with what I have done. For that reason, I am very eager to hear your side of the story, about your experience with the bot. 
> I’m willing to open my main email for suggestions even, but that would be a tad messy, so you can directly join my [support server](https://discord.gg/YgGUMvVsk7) until I get a new usable email. Because I don’t want to use a fake number and my main number is already used for too many accounts, this is the most I can do for now. I hope you don’t mind.

> Since the bot still has flaws to fix and space for improvement, I will not be taking any donations. Only when I think the bot is operating well enough will I consider having a donation link on. It is my principle that I will not take what I have not deserved (yet). And as I said, it is a passion project, I did not have anything on making profit. Having Jill BOT working is all the rewards I wanted in the first place. 

### **OTHER MISCELLANEOUS**
> I would also like to point out that in these earlier stages of the bot, downtimes are a struggle. Whenever I add something, it will probably be rebooted and have some delays. For that, I intend to clone the bot into a test bot to check functionality first. In fact, I already kind of did. Still, after replacing/editing the codes, it is going to take a while, roughly 20 seconds of downtime until the bot operates normally. I will try to manage this issue and reduce the downtime. For now, I will try my best to have her operating at least 95% of the time per day. 

> Another issue that I have been seeing is that the ping/latency value from the bot might be different to other bots. I am not sure how this comes to happen as I am not a networking expert, but I have some guesses that it is due to the location that I host the bot on. I am still very unsure about it, it could be anything else. I don’t think this problem is worrying, but I do think I need to point it out.

> One major problem though, is that I cannot figure/have not figured out a way to make it more customizable. I will be working with some others who know how to manipulate cloud data and figure out this issue. I did code her using Javascript and it is indeed not as good in cloud storage manipulation. But in any case, I will find a way to resolve this issue.

> Finally, the part that I am partly not at fault - announcements. I will be devising a way to send announcements to all servers when commands are updated or when issues are found, etc. It however only became an issue because top.gg would not let me post my announcements on her site. This is exactly why I want a Website, but I am not confident I can host that, so I will find a way later. For now, Git is the best I can offer.
